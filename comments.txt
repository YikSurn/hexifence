## Code structure

The implementation of HexiFence is split by breaking down the game into classes: Board, Cell, Edge and Point. The main logic of the simulation is implemented under GameTest.java file, where the inputs are read and saved into our designated board state, which is a simple two-dimensional array. Data in the array is then extracted to be stored as classes of Cells, Edges and Points.
